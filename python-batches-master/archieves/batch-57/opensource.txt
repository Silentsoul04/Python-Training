-------------------------------

Proprietory
------------
Company A -> Product A
       Us -> requirement -> mail to company (we will get back to you)
             internet/newsgroups -> no solution/no workaround

* Monopoly 
* customers not satified.. customer moving away.
* not satisfied.

Opensource
-----------
Company A -> Product A(GPL) -> publishes source code in internet
       Us -> requirement -> mail to company (we will get back to you)
             internet/newsgroups -> no solution/no workaround -> guys/gals we have product B/A.3
             reviews - excellent/v.good/good/bad/v.bad/worse
             
guy b/gal b(deveolper) -> download the code -> modifited -> product B(GPL) -> publish their code.
