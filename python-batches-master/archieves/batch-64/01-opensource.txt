Proprietory vs Opensource
--------------------------

proprietory - product belongs to a vendor.

ex: microsoft
  : cisco

Product A -> company A
 Us (customers) -> requirements 
                -> email company -> thank you we will get back to you soon.
		-> internet -> newgroups/workgroups -> support/workarounds

* Customer satisfaction
* Customer retention
* unsatisfied customers

Opensource
------------

Product A.1(GPL) -> company A -> publishes it source code in internet
 Us (customers) -> requirements 
                -> email company -> thank you we will get back to you soon.
		-> internet -> newgroups/workgroups -> support/workarounds. + hey there my product B is online
		-> we launched A.3 -> all feautres of b,c,d,e,f

users - developer (java/python/perl) 
      - wrappers ( small codes)
      - product B -> publishes the product

guyB/galB -> product B(GPL) -> reviews
          -> excellent/v.good/bad/v.bad

+ homogeneous code
+ hetrogeneous code
