opensource vs proprietory

Proprietory
------------
Any product owned by an individual/org is called as proprietory.
ex: windows,msoffice,cisco,facebook

Company A(10000) -> product A
Us (customers) -> requirements 
               -> post to company(email) or we publish in newsgroup/forms
               -> we will get back to you.
               
* customer retention.
* frustrated customers. 


opensource
------------

Company A(100) -> product A(GPL) -> publish your source code (github/bitbucket/cvs)
Us (customers) -> requirements 
               -> post to company(email) or we publish in newsgroup/forms
               -> we will get back to you.
guy/gal B      -> download + modify -> 
               -> product B(GPL) -> publishes the code in internet
               -> newgroups/forms -> hey there my product B
customers of b -> reviews
               -> execllent/good/bad/vbad
