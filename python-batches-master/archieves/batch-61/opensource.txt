Proprietory vs Opensource
---------------------------

company A -> Product A
Us(Customers) -> requirements -> 
              -> you put a mail to the company -> we will get back to you.
              -> internet space ->  No solution/no workaround

* customer retention.
* customer satisfaction.

ex: microsoft,ms office

Opensource
-------------

company A -> Product A(GPL) -> publishing the source code in internet
Us(Customers) -> requirements -> 
              -> you put a mail to the company -> we will get back to you.
              -> internet space ->  No solution/no workaround
              
Us(developers) guyb/galb-> product A + modification -> Product B(GPL) -> published
              -> internet space
              -> newsgroups/forms -> we have a new product B
      reviews ->  bad/v.bad/good/v.good/excellent
      
Hetrogenous/homogenous
